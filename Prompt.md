# AI Developer Instructions: Minimalist Portfolio Initialization

## Context
You are an expert Frontend Developer. Your goal is to build the first version of
the "Minimalist-Stream-Portfolio". The design should be professional, dark-themed,
and utilize a "monospaced" aesthetic.

## Technical Requirements
- Use HTML5, Tailwind CSS (via CDN for initialization), and Lucide-icons.
- No heavy JavaScript frameworks (React/Vue/etc.) allowed for this version.
- Ensure the layout is a single-column flow on mobile and scales to a centered
  container on desktop.

## Visual Guidelines
- Background: `#0a0a0a` (Zinc-950)
- Text: `#e4e4e7` (Zinc-200)
- Accent: `#3b82f6` (Blue-500)
- Typography: Inter for body, JetBrains Mono for headers/code.

## Component Tasks
1. **Header**: Name, Title (e.g., "Fullstack Developer"), and a short "Status"
   badge (e.g., "Available for work").
2. **Projects Section**: A grid of cards featuring:
   - Project Title
   - Description (2 sentences max)
   - Tech Stack Tags
   - Link to Repo
3. **Experience Section**: A simple vertical timeline.
4. **Footer**: Social links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter) and a copy-to-clipboard
   email button.

## Output Format
- Provide the full `index.html` file containing the Tailwind classes and minimal
  interactivity script.
- Ensure the code is clean, commented, and follows SEO best practices (meta
  tags).
